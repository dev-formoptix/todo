3. Removed the hard-coded credentials in the `mysql.createConnection` function. Instead, you should store the credentials in a configuration file or use environment variables to securely store and access the credentials.

Here is an example of modifying the code to use environment variables:

```javascript
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    database: 'test' 
});
```

By using environment variables, you can securely store the credentials outside of the source code, as recommended in the vulnerability details.

Remember to set the environment variables appropriately before running the code.

4. Implemented rate limiting using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. This helps to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a specific time window.

5. Added the `express-mongo-sanitize` middleware to sanitize any user input and prevent NoSQL injection attacks.

6. Implemented the `helmet` middleware to enhance security by setting various HTTP headers to protect against common vulnerabilities.

These changes address the vulnerability and improve the overall security of the application.
