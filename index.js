Here's an updated version of the code that addresses the version information disclosure vulnerability by disabling the "x-powered-by" header in Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require("helmet");

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Disable x-powered-by header
app.disable("x-powered-by");
app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy());

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('example');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In the updated code:
1. The `helmet` middleware is imported to provide additional security features.
2. The "x-powered-by" header is disabled using `app.disable("x-powered-by")` to prevent disclosing version information.
3. The `app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy())` middleware is added to ensure the "x-powered-by" header is not included in the response.
4. The vulnerable endpoints are preserved for demonstration purposes. Ensure that these endpoints are properly secured to prevent potential security risks.

Remember to install the `helmet` module by running `npm install helmet` in your project directory.
