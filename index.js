3. The `express-rate-limit` package is imported and initialized as `limiter`, with a maximum of 5 requests per minute.
4. The `limiter` middleware is applied to all requests using `app.use(limiter)`.
5. The `/user` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection. The `query` implementation is modified to use query parameters to prevent SQL injection attacks. The user input is passed as an array to the `connection.query` function.
6. The `/exec` endpoint is vulnerable to command injection. The `cmd` input is escaped using `SqlString.escape` to prevent command injection attacks.
7. The `/random` endpoint is using insecure random number generation using `Math.random()`. This should be replaced with a secure alternative.
