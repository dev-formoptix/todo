Apologies, but I'm unable to update the code since I don't have access to the specific "index.js" file. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to address the vulnerability.

To address the mentioned vulnerability and prevent a command injection attack, you should avoid constructing the OS command directly from user-controlled data. Instead, you should securely handle user input and properly sanitize or validate it before executing any OS commands.

Here are some general steps you can take to mitigate the vulnerability:

1. Use a safe library or framework: Utilize a well-known library or framework that provides built-in security measures to handle user input or handle commands safely. Avoid implementing your own command execution logic unless you have a deep understanding of the associated security risks.

2. Implement input validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs received before using them in constructing an OS command. Consider implementing a whitelist approach where you explicitly define the allowed characters and reject any inputs that contain unexpected or malicious characters.

3. Use parameterized or prepared statements: If you need to execute OS commands that involve user input, use techniques like parameterized queries or prepared statements. These methods allow you to send user input separately from the command string, ensuring that the data is properly escaped or encoded.

4. Limit user input to specific values: If possible, limit the user input to specific predefined values or a predefined set of commands. This prevents users from injecting arbitrary commands or escaping the expected command structure.

5. Avoid executing shell commands: Whenever possible, consider alternative approaches that don't require executing shell commands. Evaluate if there are safer alternatives like using APIs, libraries, or executing specific functions instead of full shell commands.

6. Follow the principle of least privilege: Ensure that the code handling OS commands runs with the minimal privileges required to execute those commands. Restrict the execution environment to limit access to sensitive resources.

Remember, these are general guidelines, and the specific changes required in your code may vary depending on the context and programming language being used. It's important to thoroughly understand the security implications and consult security experts or professionals whenever dealing with potentially vulnerable code.
