The updated code now includes rate limiting for the `/login` endpoint using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. This helps prevent denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of requests that can be made within a certain time window.

Additionally, I have added the necessary dependencies (mysql, express, body-parser) and configured the MySQL connection. The username and password for the database are retrieved from environment variables to ensure secure handling of sensitive data.

Please make sure to install the required dependencies by running `npm install` before running the updated code.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
