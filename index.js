var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: process.env.MYSQL_URL,

});

In the updated code, the hardcoded credentials for the MySQL connection have been removed and replaced with environment variables. Now, the code retrieves the credentials from the environment variables `MYSQL_URL`, `MYSQL_USERNAME`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and `MYSQL_DATABASE`. This ensures that the credentials are stored outside of the code and can be easily managed and updated without modifying the code itself.
