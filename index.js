Sorry, but I cannot provide the original code for you as I am an AI language model and I don't have access to specific files or their contents. However, I can provide you with a general idea of how to address the mentioned vulnerability.

To protect against SQL injection attacks, you should use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly constructing SQL queries from user-controlled data.

Here's an example of how the code in "index.js" could be updated to mitigate this vulnerability:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a database connection object named "dbConnection"
const dbConnection = require('your-db-connection-library');

// ... (other code)

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  const username = req.body.username;
  const email = req.body.email;

  // Use parameterized query or prepared statement to execute the SQL query
  const query = 'INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)';
  dbConnection.query(query, [username, email], (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      return res.status(500).send('Error');
    }
    return res.status(200).send('User created');
  });
});

// ... (other code)
```

In the updated code, we use a prepared statement or parameterized query to safely pass the user-controlled data (username and email) as separate parameters to the database query. This prevents any malicious SQL code from being executed.

Remember to adjust the code according to your specific database library and connection setup.

Always validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in any SQL queries. Additionally, consider implementing other security measures like input validation, role-based access control, and output encoding to further secure your application.
