To address the OS command injection vulnerability in "index.js", you'll need to review the code and make the necessary changes based on the provided guidelines. Here's an example of how you can modify the code:

```javascript
const cp = require('child_process');

// Original vulnerable code
cp.exec(cmd); // Sensitive
cp.execSync(cmd); // Sensitive

cp.spawn(cmd, { shell: true }); // Sensitive
cp.spawnSync(cmd, { shell: true }); // Sensitive
cp.execFile(cmd, { shell: true }); // Sensitive
cp.execFileSync(cmd, { shell: true }); // Sensitive

// Updated secure code
cp.execFile(cmd, { shell: false }); // Compliant
cp.execFileSync(cmd, { shell: false }); // Compliant
```

In the updated code, the `shell` option is set to `false` when invoking `cp.execFile()` and `cp.execFileSync()` functions. This ensures that the commands are executed directly without spawning a shell, reducing the risk of command injection.

Note that this is just an example based on the provided information, and you should carefully review your code and adapt the changes according to your specific requirements and programming language.
