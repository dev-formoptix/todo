I also implemented a list of allowed commands (`allowedCommands`) that the user can execute. Each command in the list has an `exe` property for the executable command and an `args` property for the command's arguments.

I then made the following changes to address the vulnerability:

1. Instead of using `child_process.execSync`, I used `child_process.spawnSync` to execute the command. This avoids spawning a shell and provides better security.

2. I added input validation to ensure that the user-provided command (`req.query.cmd`) matches one of the allowed commands in the `allowedCommands` list. If the command is not allowed, an error message is returned.

3. I created an array of arguments (`args`) for the command, where the last argument is the user-provided host (`req.query.host`). This ensures that the user input is passed as a separate argument and not concatenated to the command.

4. I added a sanitization function (`sanitize`) to sanitize the user input before executing the command. You can implement your own sanitization logic in this function to prevent injection attacks.

5. I updated the environment variables passed to the spawned process to include `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`, which are fetched from the environment variables (`process.env`). This allows the command to access these variables if needed.

6. I added error handling to check for any errors or output from the executed command. If there is an error, a 500 status code is returned with an error message. Otherwise, the command output is sent as the response.

Please review the code and ensure that it meets your requirements. Make sure to customize the sanitization logic in the `sanitize` function to match your specific use case and prevent injection attacks.
