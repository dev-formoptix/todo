I apologize for the misunderstanding. The vulnerability details you provided are related to hard-coded credentials, not the pseudorandom number generator vulnerability. 

To address the hard-coded credential vulnerability, you should update the code in the "index.js" file as follows:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: process.env.MYSQL_URL,
  user: process.env.MYSQL_USERNAME,
  password: process.env.MYSQL_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.MYSQL_DATABASE
});

connection.connect();
```

In this updated code, the credentials (host, user, password, and database) are no longer hard-coded. Instead, they are retrieved from environment variables (`process.env`). Storing credentials in environment variables allows for better security and flexibility. Make sure to set the appropriate environment variables with the actual credentials when running the application.
