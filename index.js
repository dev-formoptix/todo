I'm sorry, it seems there was a misunderstanding in your request. The original file contents you provided are related to a MySQL connection and do not include any code related to the OS command injection vulnerability.

To address the OS command injection vulnerability, you will need to provide the code in the "index.js" file that is relevant to the vulnerability. Once you provide the relevant code, I will be able to help you make the necessary changes to address the vulnerability.
