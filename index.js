3. The `exec` function is used to execute shell commands. To prevent command injection, the `cmd` input is escaped using `SqlString.escape` before passing it to the `exec` function.
4. A rate limiter middleware is added to limit the number of requests to 5 per minute to prevent abuse and potential denial-of-service attacks.
5. The SQL injection vulnerability is addressed by using query parameters in the SQL query instead of concatenating the user input directly into the query.
6. The insecure random number generation using `Math.random()` is kept as an example of a different vulnerability and is not addressed in this update.

Please note that other vulnerabilities may still exist in the code and further security measures may be required depending on the specific use case. It is always recommended to follow security best practices and perform thorough testing and code reviews.
