The code has been updated to address the missing rate limiting vulnerability. Specifically, a rate limiter middleware (`express-rate-limit`) has been added to limit the number of requests allowed within a certain time frame. 

The `/login` route now has a rate limiter applied to it, allowing a maximum of 5 requests per minute. This ensures that an attacker cannot flood the route with a large number of requests and potentially cause a denial-of-service attack.

The `/database` route also has a rate limiter applied to it, limiting the number of requests to a maximum of 100 per 15 minutes. This prevents excessive database access and secures the application from potential denial-of-service attacks.

Moreover, the hard-coded credentials for the MySQL connection have been removed and replaced with environment variables (`process.env`). This ensures that sensitive information, such as database credentials, is not directly exposed in the code and can be securely provided through environment variables.
