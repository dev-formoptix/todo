Currently, our webpack bundle size for minified js is over 13mb. I explored a little bit on reduction and have implemented some enhancements but it is still very large. One thing that might work is babel-plugin-import and use it for the antd /antd-icons imports (screenshot attached). There are probably some other options. 

I also a screenshot of the results of the bundle analyzer. I fed this into chatGPT and this is the recommendations it had:



The bundle analyzer screenshot you provided shows several large dependencies and gives a visual overview of what's contributing most to your bundle size. To reduce your minified JS file size, here are some modifications you could consider for your Webpack config:



1. **Use Dynamic Imports for Large Dependencies**: 

   You could use code-splitting to only load certain parts of a library or component when needed. For instance, if you're using lodash, you can import only the functions you need instead of the whole library.



2. **Tree Shaking**:

   Make sure Webpack's tree shaking is enabled by using ES6 module syntax (import/export) and ensure your Babel configuration is not compiling them down to CommonJS modules.



3. **Minify and Uglify**:

   Utilize plugins like `TerserPlugin` to minify your JavaScript files if not already doing so. 



4. **Externals**:

   If you have large libraries that donâ€™t change often (like React, Lodash, or Moment.js), consider loading them via a CDN and configuring them as `externals` in Webpack.



5. **Analyzing and Removing Unused Code**: 

   Use tools like `unused-webpack-plugin` or `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to find out chunks of code that are not being used and can be removed.



6. **Optimize CSS**: 

   If you have large CSS or styles brought in by JavaScript, consider optimizing them with plugins like `MiniCssExtractPlugin`, `OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin`, or `css-minimizer-webpack-plugin`.



7. **Optimizing Images and Fonts**: 

   It looks like your images and fonts might also be taking up space. You can use loaders such as `image-webpack-loader` and `url-loader` to minimize and inline small images/fonts.



8. **React-specific Optimizations**:

   For React applications, make sure you're using `React.lazy` for dynamic imports and `Suspense` for lazy loading components.



9. **Vendor Splitting**:

   Separate your vendor scripts into different chunks using the `SplitChunksPlugin` in Webpack to better cache your code.



10. **Analyze Library Usage**:

    For libraries like `react-icons`, which seems quite large, consider importing only the icons you use instead of the entire library.



Here is a small example of how you might dynamically import an icon from `react-icons`:



```javascript

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';



const DynamicIcon = ({ iconName }) => {

  const [IconComponent, setIconComponent] = useState(null);



  useEffect(() => {

    const importIcon = async () => {

      try {

        const { [iconName]: Icon } = await import('react-icons/fa');

        setIconComponent(<Icon />);

      } catch (error) {

        console.log(error);

      }

    };



    importIcon();

  }, [iconName]);



  return IconComponent;

};

```



Then you can use this `DynamicIcon` component and pass the icon name as a prop.



Finally, ensure that all your production plugins are only used in production and not included during development builds. This will speed up your development build times and ensure that plugins like `TerserPlugin` do not consume resources when not needed. 



Combining these strategies should help reduce the overall size of your bundle.
